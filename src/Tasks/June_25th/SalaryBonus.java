 Calculate Bonus Based on Salary and Years of Experience.

          :- take the salary and Year info from the User.

Implement Bonus Calculation Logic:

     Define the bonus structure based on salary and years of experience.

           :- If years of experience is less than 1 year: No bonus.

           :- If years of experience is between 1 and 3 years: Bonus is 5% of the salary.

           :- If years of experience is between 4 and 6 years: Bonus is 10% of the salary.

           :- If years of experience is greater than 6 years: Bonus is 15% of the salary.
